## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a unique journey - I transitioned from designing physical buildings as an Architecture graduate to architecting digital solutions in software. This background gives me a distinctive approach to problem-solving, where I apply spatial thinking and structural design principles to create robust, scalable applications.

My passion lies in building impactful solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether it's creating secure platforms for sensitive reporting, developing location-based dating apps, or building comprehensive ticketing systems, I bring the same attention to detail and user-centric approach that I once applied to architectural designs.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, writing technical articles, or mentoring aspiring developers who are making their own career transitions.
